After her near death experience 26 years ago, when she saw the<em>Black Curtain</em>and was diagnosed with multiple life threatening illnesses, Jeane was given only two short weeks to live. Through her own self discovery and spiritual journey Lavina has made a full recovery. Seeking innovative and cutting edge healing methods has led her to Reconnective Healing, holistic therapies, and Angel Attunements. Jeane now feels guided to share her healing gifts and her story so that others may be lifted up and healed.</p><blockquote><p>“Jeane has a healing gift! Her session was an exceptional experience, which far exceeded my understanding.” Lynn Miller</p></blockquote><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d037b3cc-bd57-4954-b332-29c0e93563e6.jpg"><p>Gina Paris is a self-taught international interior designer, inspirational speaker, intuitive healer, and author. Through her intuitive design process, Gina recognizes the healing affects renewed spaces hove on her clients. Gina’s holistic journey began 26 years ago when her mother, Lavina Jeane, became deathly ill and Gina cared for her mother and her siblings. In 1997 Gina’s first child, Brady, sustained severe brain damage during delivery and was given two months to live. Together Gina and Jeane searched for treatments outside of main stream medicine to provide a more comfortable life for Brady. Although Brady passed away November 6, 2012- at the age of 15 1/2, Gina continues to grow and learn about the metaphysical world, and enjoys sharing the healing gifts she’s acquired with others so that they may find the peace and comfort within this world that she has.</p><blockquote><p>“Gina’s ability to work with energy is amazing! She did a Reconnective Healing session with me that brought great results!” Sarah Sheppard</p></blockquote><p>Now, mother and daughter share their love, wisdom, and powerful healing gifts with others so that they too may find love and health. Jeane and Gina are co-creators of<em>Work with Angels</em>, a spiritual boutique offering an array of innovative and cutting edge healing methods; which include Reconnective Healing®, Distance/Remote Healing, and Angel Attunements, just to name a few.</p><p>Intrigued?
