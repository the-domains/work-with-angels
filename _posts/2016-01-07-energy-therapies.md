An energy therapy that facilitates healing by bringing light and information to the body through the frequencies surrounding it. You may experience tingling, hot and cold chills, and other sensations during the treatment. This is a very gentle form of energy healing, and your body will begin to integrate the energy shifts immediately.

A unique healing modality known only to Gina and Jeane. When the mother and daughter team work together their energetic power and strength is amplified- promoting a faster healing.

Cleaning and opening the dirty and/or blocked chakras. Chakras are the energy centers of our energetic bodies and they affect our physical bodies causing dis-ease when they become blocked, unclean, or both. Clearing and balancing your chakras will leave your ethereal and physical bodies feeling cleansed and in balance.  null

All of these energy treatments are "hands off" so there is no need to worry if your in physical pain. We work with your energy field- not on your physical body. Your energy field is connected to all universal energy, which means that energy therapies may be facilitated from a distance. Remote healing sessions are equally effective as ones given in person, and allow you to remain at home.
